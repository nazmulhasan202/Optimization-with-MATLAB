# [MATLAB-Codes] Genetic-Algorithm-GA-with-Sample-Example-Problem-
These codes are related to a video (https://youtu.be/lsZ6F7rsX6A) that illustrates how to deal with a Multi-objective Optimization problem using Genetic Algorithm (GA) in MATLAB with a sample example. All the steps for generation of "Pareto Optimal Solution" and "Pareto Front" are also clearly illustrated in that video.
