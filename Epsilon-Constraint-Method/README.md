# [MATLAB-Codes] Epsilon-Constraint-Method

These codes are related to solving the following problem using epsilon-constraint method. The first objective function (As) is considered as the primary objective function (f1) and the second objective function (V) is bounded by a desired epsilon value (f2 >= epsilon_f2 i.e., epsilon_f2 - f2 <= 0) in the "cons_ecm.m" file as a formulation under epsilon-constraint method.
