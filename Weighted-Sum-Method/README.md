# [MATLAB-Codes] Weighted-Sum-Method
These codes are related to a video (https://youtu.be/_Ulg0y1JiN4) that illustrates how to deal with a Multi-objective Optimization problem using Weighted Sum Method in MATLAB with a sample example. Also, different core concepts associated with the Weighted Sum Method is discussed in the video. Ways of generation of "Pareto Optimal Solution" and "Pareto Front" are presented.
